## Refactor Notes:
- Use `try/except` to catch unexpected input (currently handled manually)
- Consider using external word list instead of `wonderwords` for consistency
## Possible Improvements:
- Add categories for words (music, movies, countries, etc.) for more variety
- Allow player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program
- Add scoring system
- Improve hangman figure for more lives (10 instead of 6)
- Save high scores / best streak
